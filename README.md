An Injector to use with Dagger2

# Senior Android Developer Note

Best Practices Justifications:

1. Injecting by-hand involves a lot of un-needed boilerplate when using Dagger2. 
   We can use component reflection to inject through a base class and 
   even though it is using reflection it only costs us about 0.013ms per injection 
   on a slow device. Of course, we are using the initialization splash screen 
   in conjunction with dagger2 usage.

# Usage

if library, describe how to download library using jitpack than describe how to use the library.

I use jitpack to upload my libraries so you put this in your root buildscript:

```groovy
allprojects {
        repositories {
            jcenter()
            maven { url "https://jitpack.io" }
        }
   }
```
Than in the module buildscript:


```groovy
compile 'com.github.shareme:GWSDaggerInjector:{latest-release-number}@aar'
```
